# Content Ranking

This part of module will rank all the summarized contents and return the 1st content to the client. The content_ranker.js module is designed to rank user-generated content based on user preferences. It interfaces with the OpenAI API to generate related words for user preferences and then evaluates and ranks content based on the frequency of these words and the semantic relation beween the words and the contents.

## Dependencies

langchain: This module provides interfaces to interact with the OpenAI API.
sqlite3: Used for database operations, specifically fetching user data from a database file.

## Functions

### getEmbeddings(text)
Parameters:

text (String): The text for which embeddings are to be fetched.
Description:
Fetches embeddings for a given text using the OpenAI API. This is useful for advanced content analysis and similarity calculations.

Returns:
A Promise that resolves to an Array of embeddings for the given text.

### cosineSimilarity(vecA, vecB)
Parameters:

vecA (Array): The first vector.
vecB (Array): The second vector.
Description:
Calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors. This is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them.

Returns:
The cosine similarity (a number) between the two vectors.

### combinedScore(content, preferencesVector, generatedWords)

Parameters:

content (String): The content to score.
preferencesVector (Array): The preferences vector obtained from embeddings.
generatedWords (Array): An array of words generated based on user preferences.
Description:
Calculates a combined score for a piece of content based on the cosine similarity between the content's embeddings and the preferences vector, as well as the frequency of generated words in the content.

Returns:
A Promise that resolves to a number representing the combined relevance score of the content.

### generateRelatedWords(preferences)

Parameters:
preferences (String): A string containing user preferences, usually comma-separated.

Description:
Queries the OpenAI API to generate related words based on the provided user preferences.

Returns:
An object containing the original user preferences and an array of generated related words.

### countWordOccurrences(word, content)

Parameters:
word (String): The word for which occurrences need to be counted.
content (String): The content string in which to count occurrences of the word.

Description:
Counts the occurrences of a specific word within a given content string.

Returns:
The count of occurrences of the word in the content.

### scoreContent(generatedWords, content)

Parameters:
generatedWords (Array): An array of words (related to user preferences) to be counted in the content for scoring.
content (String): The content string to be scored.

Description:
Scores a piece of content based on the frequency of generated words related to user preferences.

Returns:
A score representing the relevance of the content to the user preferences.


### rankContents(contents, preferencesVector, generatedWords)

Parameters:

contents (Array): An array of content strings to be ranked.
preferencesVector (Array): The vector representing user preferences.
generatedWords (Array): An array of words related to user preferences.
Description:
Extended to rank each piece of content based on a combined score, which includes both the relevance to the user preferences (as determined by cosine similarity) and the frequency of generated words within the content.

Returns:
A Promise that resolves to an array of content objects sorted by their combined score in descending order.

### getTopContent(preferences, contents)
Parameters:

preferences (String): The user's preferences.
contents (Array): An array of content strings to be evaluated and ranked.
Description:
Generates related words and a preferences vector for the user's preferences, then scores and ranks each piece of content based on these elements, ultimately returning the highest-scoring content.

Returns:
A Promise that resolves to the content string with the highest combined score.

## Usage

To use the module:

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed via npm.
Import the necessary functions from the module.
Provide user preferences and content strings to the getTopContent function to get the top-ranked content.
